        "\n",
        "This project, Plantify or Plant Health Detector, applies computer vision to classify plant images as healthy or diseased.\n",
        "The goal is to help everyday gardeners identify early signs of plant disease before visible damage becomes severe.\n",
        "By fine-tuning a YOLOv8 classification model, we aim to train a system that recognizes general plant health from photos taken in outdoor garden conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "Many home gardeners struggle to detect early plant stress or infection, which often leads to preventable plant loss.\n",
        "Our model analyzes plant photos and classifies them into two categories, Healthy and Diseased, to support better plant care and timely action.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Users**\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary users are home gardeners and plant enthusiasts who want a quick, AI-based way to check the health of their plants.\n",
        "In practice, this could be integrated into a mobile or web app that allows users to upload or capture plant images and instantly get feedback on their health condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feedback and Revisions**\n",
        "\n",
        "After receiving feedback from Dr. Yalcin and our classmates, we refined our project to make it more focused and realistic. We chose to concentrate on a smaller set of common outdoor garden plants because they are widely grown and show clear visual signs of health or disease. Our model now classifies only two conditions, healthy or diseased, regardless of plant type. This change keeps the project manageable and ensures that Plantify remains practical and useful for home and community gardeners who care for outdoor plants.\n",

        "\n",
        "While collecting and combining data, we encountered several minor issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Misplaced images:** Some images were incorrectly categorized (e.g., healthy leaves inside diseased folders). We manually reviewed and corrected these errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Class imbalance:** The dataset contained more diseased images (≈63%) than healthy ones (≈37%). To reduce this bias, we oversampled healthy images during training and applied data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and color adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lighting and background variation**: While most Kaggle images had uniform backgrounds. To improve consistency, we ensured diverse conditions were included in both classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "We addressed these issues through careful verification, balancing, and augmentation, making the dataset more representative of real-world garden conditions."
